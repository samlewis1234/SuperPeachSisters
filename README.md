# SuperPeachSisters

In this project I was given a template of a Super Mario Bros-style game, which consisted of code for graphics and audio. What I did was write code for the gameplay elements of loading in the levels, input behavior, object behavior, object interaction, and score and game progress. This can be found in the following files: StudentWorld.cpp, StudentWorld.h, Actor.h, and Actor.cpp.

If anyone wishes to run this themselves, they must unzip the assets folder (containing graphics and audio files), and change the line pointing to its directory in StudentWorld.cpp.

Here are a couple screenshots of the game in action:
